This often draws viewers’ curiosity to know about their earnings. They question how the show compensates for their time.</p><p>When an individual signs up to be on a reality show, they aren’t just dedicating a few hours of their day that will air on primetime. Rather they agree to 24/7 access to their private space.</p><figure></figure><p>Zeus Network, a subscription-based video streaming service, features a variety of original scripted and unscripted shows on its channel.</p><p>Unscripted reality shows include Baddies and its all follow-up seasons, Pretty Girls Lit, A Taste of Dance with Amanda Cerny, The Conversation, Doses of Draya, and more.</p><p>The stars of various shows are paid accordingly based on their time and contribution.
