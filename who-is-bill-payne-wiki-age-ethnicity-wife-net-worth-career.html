He played for the University of Georgia as a sophomore in 1996. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science with honors in 1969. He then earned his law degree from the School of Law in 1973. Then, in 1991, he received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Oglethorpe University.</p><h2>Bill Payne Age, Height, Weight</h2><p><strong>Bill Payne</strong> was born on October 13, 1947, and is 75 years old as of today. His height is 182 cm, and he weighs 90 kg.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Billy-Payne-1.jpg><h2>Career</h2><p>Payne dreamed of hosting the Olympics in Atlanta in 1987, and he sought support from all over the world. Then he got the backing of then-mayor Andrew Young, as well as private support and sponsors. The IOC chose Atlanta to host the 1996 Olympics, much to his surprise. Even after winning the bid, he remained the chairman of the Atlanta Olympic Committee.</p><p>Payne was named chairman of Augusta National Golf Club, home of the Master’s Tournament, on May 5, 2006, succeeding Hootie Johnson. Payne began working for the club at the start of the season in October of the same year.</p><p>Payne criticized Tiger Woods before that year’s Masters on April 7, 2010, claiming that he had failed as a role model.</p><p>The following year, Payne and his fellow Augusta National members implemented another modern change to their featured golf tournament. They also authorized the video game “Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12,” which was designed to inspire future generations of golfers. The proceeds from the video game’s sales would go to a non-profit foundation that promotes young golfers.</p><p>On August 23, 2017, Augusta National announced that Payne would step down as chairman of the club effective October 16, 2017, and would be succeeded by Fred Ridley.</p><p>He began his career as the chairman of Centennial Holding Company, based in Atlanta. The company was dealing with fund management issues.</p><h2>Bill Payne Wife, Marriage</h2><p><strong>Bill Payne</strong> received the Olympic Order in Gold in 1996 at the Atlanta Games’ Closing Ceremonies. In addition, he was elected as a Georgia Trustee in 2014. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in the lifetime achievement category in the class of 2019.</p><p>Aside from that, one of his greatest achievements was persuading members of the International Olympic Committee to hold the Olympics in Atlanta, a dream that was realized in 1996. He also pushed for the first women to be admitted to the club’s membership, which had never been done before.</p><h2>Bill Payne’s Net Worth in 2023</h2><p><strong>Bill Payne</strong> fortune stems primarily from his position as chairman of Augusta National Golf Club. He held that position from 2006 to 2017 and earned a substantial salary as a result.</p><p>He is also the Vice-Chairman of Bank of America, the Managing Director of Gleacher & Company, the Vice Chairman of WebMD, a member of the board of directors of Lincoln National Corporation and cousin’s properties, and the Vice Chairman of Premiere Global Services, Inc. He has a net worth of $2 million as of September 2023.</p><p>After retiring, Payne will be remembered for being the first chairman of Augusta National Golf Club to admit a female as a member.</p><h2>Bill Payne Wife, Marriage</h2><p>When it comes to his personal information, Payne is a very private person. Regardless, we know he is a married man. Martha Beard is the lucky woman in his life, and they married in 1968 and have been happily married ever since. His wife was the CEO of IBM at the time, and she was also the first female to join the ANGC in 2012. They have two children, a daughter, and a son.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZoqScYr2ixc2eZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-bill-payne-wiki-age-ethnicity-wife-net-worth-career.html&text=Who%20Is%20Bill%20Payne%3f%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-bill-payne-wiki-age-ethnicity-wife-net-worth-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-bill-payne-wiki-age-ethnicity-wife-net-worth-career.html&title=Who%20Is%20Bill%20Payne%3f%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-bill-payne-wiki-age-ethnicity-wife-net-worth-career.html&title=Who%20Is%20Bill%20Payne%3f%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-bill-payne-wiki-age-ethnicity-wife-net-worth-career.html&title=Who%20Is%20Bill%20Payne%3f%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-bill-payne-wiki-age-ethnicity-wife-net-worth-career.html&description=Who%20Is%20Bill%20Payne%3f%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./asier-riesgo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Asier Riesgo">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-seungri-net-worth-2024-sources-of-wealth-income-salary-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Seungri Net Worth 2024: Sources of Wealth, Income/Salary &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
