Bill Edwards, a college football coach in the College Football Hall of Fame, was Bill’s godfather.</span></p><p><span>Ivan Bilii and Marija Mary Barkovi, Belichick’s paternal grandparents, left the Croatian hamlet of Dragani, Karlovac, in 1897 and settled in Monessen, Pennsylvania. Belichick is of Croatian descent.</span></p><p><span>Bill’s Father was an assistant football coach at the United States Naval Academy, and he was raised in Annapolis, Maryland.</span></p><p><span>Belichick frequently studied football with his Father, who he has acknowledged as one of his most significant football instructors.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bill-belichick-married-life-and-children></span><span>Bill Belichick Married Life And Children</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Businesswomen Debby Clarke and Belichick wed in 1977; however, they divorced in the summer of 2006.

Belichick was also charged with having a romantic relationship with divorced former Giants receptionist Sharon Shenocca.</span></p><p><span>The Bill Belichick Foundation Executive director, Linda Holliday, and Belichick have been dating since 2007.</span></p><p><span>With Debby Clarke Belichick, Amanda, Stephen, and Brian are his three children. At Wesleyan University, where she played lacrosse like her Father, Amanda graduated in 2007.</span></p><p><span>After graduating from college, she worked as a lacrosse coach in the Connecticut prep school Choate Rosemary Hall admissions office.</span></p><p><span>She joined the University of Massachusetts Amherst women’s lacrosse team in 2009 as an assistant coach before accepting the same role with the Ohio State Buckeyes the following year.</span></p><p><span>She was appointed head women’s lacrosse coach at Holy Cross College in Massachusetts in July 2015 after serving as interim head women’s lacrosse coach at Wesleyan.</span></p><p><span>Stephen received a scholarship to play football and lacrosse at Rutgers University.
